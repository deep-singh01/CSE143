# CSE143
UW CSE 143 - Prof. Stuart Reges (Fall '22)

Course Description: This course is a continuation of CSE142. While CSE142 focused on control issues (loops, conditionals,
methods, parameter passing, etc), CSE143 focuses on data issues. Topics include: ADTs (abstract data types),
stacks, queues, linked lists, binary trees, recursion, interfaces, inheritance and encapsulation. The course also
introduces the notion of complexity and performance tradeoffs in examining classic algorithms such as sorting
and searching and classic data structures such as lists, sets and maps. The course will include a mixture of data
structure implementation as well as using off-the-shelf components from the Java Collections Framework. The
prerequisite is CSE142 or equivalent.
